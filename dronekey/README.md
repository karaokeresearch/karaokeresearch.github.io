# Drone Key

Insanity. Download, place everything on a web server, visit the URL. Won't work on the local file system for some reason.

Edit dronekey.js to change pitch, turn on effects, change background color, etc. For background color, pink is the default. Change to #00ff00 to use a chromakey for visual overlay or black for projecting over performers.

## Instructions

Once the page is loaded, start typing to trigger the sounds and emojis. The keyboard is broken into ten columns each representing a single instrument broken into four of the individual notes of the active chord. In the case of chords with three notes, the bottom row plays one octave over the root note.
